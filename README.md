## Description
Struggling to find a place to eat? Moved to a new city and aren't sure what's around you, but don't want to have to sift through maps? Dinder is for you!

Dinder is an app meant to be used as a way to more easily decide where you want to eat when you just can't decide where to go. 

Coming to the Play Store soon! *(Hopefully)*
